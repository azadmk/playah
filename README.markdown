Playo is an interactive HTML5 player that focuses in the really efficient new features of HTML5. In order to keep it simple and agile, I designed the whole player with [Windows 8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_%28design_language%29) style, the new design language of Microsoft.

Also, it is built with the latest web technologies and practices in mind, such as CSS3 and LESS, the CSS preprocessor. Furthermore, I used some fairly new aspects of HTML, such as `data-elements` and of course the `audio` HTML5 tag which is automatically associated with the audio API of the supported browser.
